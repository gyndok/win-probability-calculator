- Red: <25% chance of winning

## Formula Used

The win probability is calculated using the following formula:
```
Lead = YourTeamScore - OpponentScore
TimeRemaining = MinutesRemaining + (SecondsRemaining / 60)
TimeFactor = TimeRemaining ^ 0.4
ExponentNumerator = 0.5 * Lead
Exponent = ExponentNumerator / TimeFactor
Probability = 1 / (1 + Exp(-Exponent))
Final Probability = Probability * 100 (to get percentage)
```
